    print("- **Physical Health**: It aids in tissue repair, hormone regulation (e.g., growth hormone release), and immune system strengthening. Adequate sleep reduces the risk of chronic conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and obesity.")
    print("- **Emotional Regulation**: Sleep helps regulate mood and stress hormones, preventing issues like anxiety and depression. It also supports mental resilience.")

    print("- **Physical Health Risks**: Higher chances of obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and weakened immunity, as sleep deprivation disrupts metabolism and inflammation control.")
    print("- **Mental Health Issues**: Elevated risk of depression, anxiety, and mood disorders due to imbalances in neurotransmitters like serotonin.")
    print("- **Other Effects**: Fatigue, weakened immune response (making one more susceptible to illnesses), and hormonal disruptions affecting appetite and energy levels.")

Policies, such as data privacy laws, govern how this information is collected, stored, and shared.")
    print("- **Importance of Privacy**: Sleep data can reveal sensitive details about health, routines, and vulnerabilities. Breaches could lead to identity theft, discrimination (e.g., by insurers), or targeted ads. Strong privacy ensures trust in technologies like wearable devices.")
    print("- **Key Policies**: Regulations like the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the US's Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) mandate consent, data minimization, and user rights over health data. Companies must implement encryption and anonymization to comply.")
